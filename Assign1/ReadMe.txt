Note: All the files MUST be in a FOLDER, and you have to run R from that folder from cmd.

To run csc591_Assignment1.R:
-----------------------------
1. Navigate to the folder from terminal.
2. Type Rscript csc591_Assignment1.Rscript

To run preprocess.R:
--------------------
1. Type install.packages("zoo") # this is used for interpolating missing values
2. Navigate to the folder from terminal.
3. Type Rscript preprocess.Rscript


Description of csc591_Assignment1.R
------------------------------------
Input: 
Two preprocessed .csv files; student_step_clean.csv and student_prb_clean.csv.

Output:
1. A file named per_std_stats.csv containing two basic statistics computed for each student:
      a. total correct first attempts
	  b. total step durations (sec)
	  
2. On console, the mean, median, min, and max of two above statistics are 
   printed. The code computes these values twice: without excluding outliers
   and excluding outliers. As there is no outlier for the two statistics computed, these values
   are printed once only.
   
3. Rplots.pdf is generated by R which contains the qqnorm() plot and the histogram of
   the two computed statistics. 
   

   
Description of preprocess.R
--------------------------------
Input:
Two raw files downloaded and renamed from Datashop project EDM Summer School 2017, dataset name: Geometry Area (1996-97).
  a. student_problem.txt
  b. student_step.txt
  
Output:
Two .csv files with missing values interpolated. Polynomial interpolation was used from zoo
package.
    a. student_prb_clean.csv
	b.student_step_clean.csv
